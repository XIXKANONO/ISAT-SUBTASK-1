GitHub:

- Key Features:
    1. Version Control: GitHub allows developers to track changes made to their codebase over time, ensuring that all changes are documented and can be reverted if necessary.
    2. Collaboration: GitHub enables teams to collaborate on projects by allowing multiple users to contribute to a single repository, making it easy to work together on code.
    3. Open-Source Community: GitHub has a large community of open-source developers who share and contribute to projects, making it easy to find and use existing code.

GitLab:

- Key Features:
    1. Version Control: GitLab also offers version control, similar to GitHub, allowing developers to track changes made to their codebase.
    2. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): GitLab has built-in CI/CD pipelines, making it easy to automate testing and deployment, reducing the time and effort required to get code from development to production.
    3. Issue Tracking: GitLab has a built-in issue tracking system, allowing teams to manage bugs and tasks, making it easy to keep track of what needs to be done.

Licensing:

- GitHub: Offers a mix of free and paid plans, with some features limited to paid plans, such as advanced security features and support.
- GitLab: Offers a more permissive licensing approach, with most features available in the free plan, making it a more accessible option for small teams and individual developers.
